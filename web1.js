this is my first commit for session 1- javascript

 in this session i learnt that what is javascript and  Why Does It Dominate the Web?
 JavaScript is the backbone of interactivity on the web. Unlike HTML (which structures content) and CSS (which styles it), JavaScript controls behavior, it makes web pages dynamic,
  responsive, and interactive.
  It runs in the browser and allows developers to add animations, handle user inputs, update content dynamically, and communicate with servers.
  JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it executes one operation at a time in a single call stack.

  why does dominate the web ?

  1. JavaScript is the only programming language that web browsers natively understand.
  2.This universal support makes it unavoidable for web developers.
  3. JavaScript is used by 97% of all websites worldwide (including giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon).
  4. JavaScript allows real-time updates, user interactions, and animations.
  5. JavaScript on both the frontend and backend.
  6.  JavaScript on both the frontend and backend.
  7.- JavaScript has powerful libraries and frameworks like: - React.js , Angular & Vue.js , Express.js .
  
  1. JavaScript is Growing with AI & Machine Learning - 
  JavaScript is evolving with AI & Machine Learning through powerful libraries like TensorFlow.js, Brain.js, and Synaptic.js. 
  The combination of JavaScript and AI is making web apps smarter, faster, and more interactive.

And also i learn about JIT(Just In Time) Compilation?
 JIT Compilation is a hybrid approach that combines interpretation and  compilation to improve JavaScript execution speed.JIT combines both approaches â€“ it compiles JavaScript into machine code while the program is running, making it much faster than traditional interpretation.
  
JavaScript is Single-Threaded because JavaScript executes code sequentially, one operation at a time.
